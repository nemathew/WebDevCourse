    <h1>Harry Potter</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Personal Characteristics</h2>

    <p>Harry Potter is a strange young man who grew up in less than ideal conditions. His loving parents died when
        Voldemort killed them, but in doing so, they saved their son through the power of love--leaving Harry with a
        permanent scar to remember this by.
    </p>

    <p>He was then sent to live with his aunt and uncle who were these very cruel non-magical people. They spointed
        their own son rotten, giving him anything he wanted, putting up with his tantrums, and turning him into an awful
        human. At the same time, they treated Harry like he was worth nothing, forcing him to live under the stairs in
        the small cramped closet and starving him anytime anything happened</p>

    <p>We'll dive more into his story, but for now here are some characteristics: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scar shapped like a lightning bolt on his forehead</li>
        <li>Almost always has broken glasses</li>
        <li>Short brown hair</li>
        <li>He has his mother's eyes</li>
    </ul>
